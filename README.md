# Tumoroscope in PyMC

**WIP**

This package builds the ['Tumoroscope']() (Shafighi *et al.*, 2022, bioRxiv preprint) model with the probabilistic programming library [PyMC]().
'Tumoroscope' is a "probabilistic model that accurately infers cancer clones and their high-resolution localization by integrating pathological images, whole exome sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics data."
