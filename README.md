**WIP**

This package builds the ['Tumoroscope']() (Shafighi *et al.*, 2022, bioRxiv preprint) model with the probabilistic programming library [PyMC]().
'Tumoroscope' is a "probabilistic model that accurately infers cancer clones and their high-resolution localization by integrating pathological images, whole exome sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics data."

## Installation

> As this package provides a model produced using PyMC, I recommend first creating a virtual environment using `conda` and installing the PyMC library.
> You can follow their instructions [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/installation.html).

You can install this package using `pip` either from PyPI

```bash
pip install tumoroscope-pymc  # not available yet
```

or from GitHub

```
pip install git+https://github.com/jhrcook/tumoroscope-pymc.git
```

## Use
